            Tech Games is McGill's Olympics of practical Software Engineering
            and Computer Science challenges. Grab some friends, your favorite
            (caffeinated) drink and your IDE of choice and put your skills to
            the test from the comfort of your own homes for the chance for some
            cool prizes.
            <br />
            This year, join us on Gather Town: team up in groups of 3 to 5, rack
            up points by competing in challenges in Backend Development, Mobile
            Development, Functional Programming, Relay Programming, and Xtreme
            Theory (that's right, not just regular theory ðŸ˜‰) challenges, and
            flex your wits by grinding through waves of puzzles!
