            Tech Games is McGill's Olympics of practical Software Engineering
            and Computer Science challenges. Grab some friends, your favorite
            (caffeinated) drink and your IDE of choice and put your skills to
            the test from the comfort of your own homes for the chance for some
            cool prizes.
            <br />
            This year, join us on Gather Town: team up in groups of 3 to 5, rack
            up points by competing in challenges in Backend Development, Mobile
            Development, Functional Programming, Relay Programming, and Xtreme
            Theory (that's right, not just regular theory üòâ) challenges, and
            flex your wits by grinding through waves of puzzles!

                build what you can in the given time and provide a short demo of
                your creation. The design is completely up to you, the most
                usable app wins!

            <li>Long events (Backend and Mobile) are worth 150 points</li>
            <li>
              Short events (Functional, Xtreme Theory, Stack Overflow) are worth
              75 points

                Points are relative to placement in the event. 1st = 100% of
                points 2nd = 95% of points, 3rd = 90% of points ‚Ä¶
              </li>
              <li>
                In the event of a tie, both teams are awarded equal points. Ex:
                3 teams tied for 4th each get 85% of points and the next team
                would get 5th place with 80% of points.
